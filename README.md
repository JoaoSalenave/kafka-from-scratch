# Kafka From Scratch (Codecrafters Challenge)

This project is part of the Codecrafters challenge where I am building a simplified version of a Kafka broker from scratch using **Python**.

##  Tech Stack:

- Python 3.12
- TCP Sockets (low-level networking)
- Kafka wire protocol concepts
- Basic producer/consumer architecture

##  Main Objective:

A basic Kafka-like message broker that:
- Accepts connections from producers and consumers over TCP.
- Handles simple publish/subscribe message flows.
- Processes binary messages following the Kafka wire protocol.
- Manages internal message queues.

##  Key Learning Outcomes:

- Low-level networking with TCP sockets
- Kafka internals & message streaming concepts
- Basics of distributed systems: producers, consumers, queues
- Wire protocol design & implementation
