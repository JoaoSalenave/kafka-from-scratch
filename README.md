# Kafka From Scratch (Codecrafters Challenge)

This project is part of the Codecrafters challenge where I am building a simplified version of a Kafka broker from scratch using **Python**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- TCP Sockets (low-level networking)
- Kafka wire protocol concepts
- Basic producer/consumer architecture

## 🚀 What I am building

A basic Kafka-like message broker that:
- Accepts connections from producers and consumers over TCP.
- Handles simple publish/subscribe message flows.
- Processes binary messages following the Kafka wire protocol.
- Manages internal message queues.

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- Low-level networking with TCP sockets
- Kafka internals & message streaming concepts
- Basics of distributed systems: producers, consumers, queues
- Wire protocol design & implementation

## 🔄 Future improvements
- Rebuild in Go for performance comparison.
- Implement multi-threaded queue management.
- Deploy a distributed version with Docker Compose.
